## About

### What is this network?

Founded in 2019, the Helium Network is a blockchain-based, decentralized wireless network that allows people and devices to connect with the Internet. Participants who deploy wireless hardware on behalf of the network are rewarded with Helium's native token, HNT, as an incentive for maintaining and expanding the network's coverage.  It is known as "The People's Network" because it is owned and operated by the community of users rather than a centralized entity.

Helium initially launched with an IoT-focused network called LoRaWAN and enjoyed great success, motivating hundreds of thousands of people around the world to deploy nearly 1M “hotspots” providing IoT coverage.

The overarching network is not limited to IoT use cases and Helium is now expanding to other wireless technologies, including a CBRS-based cellular network and a future WiFi network. The project is flexible and future-proof, aiming to create a more affordable, efficient, and accessible method of building the wireless networks of the future.

### How can I mine $MOBILE tokens?

You can mine MOBILE tokens using an 5G hotspot. This involves purchasing a Helium hotspot device, which acts as a node on the network, and using it to provide wireless coverage to IoT devices or 5G cellular devices. Node operators are rewarded with HNT tokens for providing coverage and relaying data on the network.

### Any geographical restrictions?

The 5G network utilizes CBRS spectrum in the 3.55-3.7 GHz range. Mining is currently only active in the United States as it’s the first major country to open up cellular spectrum to the public. To mine Helium on the 5G network, you need to have a compatible 5G Helium hotspot and be located in an area with CBRS spectrum availability. Spectrum is generally available all across the US, with the exception of some naval ports and where PALs (priority access license holders) have purchased access that subsumes your own. It's worth noting that the Helium 5G network and its coverage may expand to other countries in the future as they gain access to similar spectrum bands.

### How can I optimize my mining rewards?

There are also several ways to optimize your mining rewards for Helium’s 5G network:

1. Location: For proof-of-coverage earnings, hotspots located in areas with too much existing coverage will earn less than hotspots that are providing non-redundant coverage in new areas. For data transfer earnings, being in a more densely populated area is likely better. You can use the Helium Explorer website or app to see the coverage and density of devices in your area.
2. Cell Placement: The placement of your 5G cell can also impact your mining rewards. You should aim to position your cell directly covering your targeted area with as few obstructions as possible. This will maximize the potential of data transfer between your cell and your users.
3. Power and Internet Connectivity: You should ensure that your Helium 5G hotspot is connected to a stable power source and has a reliable internet connection, ideally with low latency and high bandwidth, to ensure consistent and reliable operation.

Overall, the key to optimizing your mining rewards on Helium's IoT and 5G networks is to ensure your Hotspot is well-positioned, properly maintained, providing new or at least not overly redundant coverage, and actively participating in the network. By maximizing your Hotspot's coverage and network participation, you can increase your chances of earning rewards and contributing to the growth of the Helium network.

### How can I use the network?

For cellular use cases, Helium 5G equipment can provide cellular connection that is fast and reliable in areas where TradWi networks may struggle to provide adequate service. This can be a significant benefit for businesses, event organizers, and individuals who need high-speed internet access in these types of environments. Additionally, Helium has recently launched a mobile phone plan that leverages its network and will even incentivize users for using it.

### Who governs this network?

To facilitate community participation in the network's governance, Helium has implemented a unique governance model known as the [Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP)](https://github.com/helium/HIP) process. The HIP process allows stakeholders to submit proposals for network improvements, which are then reviewed and [voted on by other stakeholders](https://heliumvote.com/). This process ensures that the network's stakeholders have a say in its development and ensures that the network evolves in a decentralized and community-driven manner.

Furthermore, Helium's network is designed to be open and transparent, with all network activity and data recorded on the network's blockchain, which is publicly accessible. This ensures that the network's operations and decisions are open to public scrutiny, promoting transparency and accountability.

## Scores

1-10, 10 being "best"

### Governance: 7/10

The governance of the Helium network is facilitated by the community through their voting and submission of Helium Improvement Proposals (HIPs). The Helium Foundation, a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization, and Nova Labs, Inc., a corporation, are the current governing entities responsible for implementing these changes. The Helium Foundation possesses complete control over the brand assets and intellectual property of Helium, and they intend to oversee the maintenance of the Helium blockchain, miner, and Hotspot app source code. Meanwhile, Nova Labs, Inc. continues to play an essential role in issuing chain-variables and rescue blocks while also sharing signing responsibility with The Helium Foundation. Further information can be obtained from this Medium article.

### Tokenomics: 7/10

Helium's HNT token issuance began in August 2019 with a planned maximum supply of 60 million but only 43 million were issued due to slow block times. The adjusted max supply is now 223 million due to token halving every two years. HNT has two basic functions, one being the token itself and the other being Data Credits, which are pegged to $USD (one Data Credit remains constant at $0.00001) and derived from HNT through a burn transaction. Data Credits are used to pay for wireless data transmission fees on the network, and HNT adjusts to network usage patterns through a burn and mint equilibrium design. Net Emissions provide enough HNT to reward consensus group members and hotspots, but there will be a cap on the number of HNT created via Net Emissions to maintain the deflationary effect of Burn and Mint. Net Emissions has yet to become active.

Following the approval of HIP51, the Helium DAO was established to facilitate the creation of subDAOs to allow for a plethora of communication networks on the Helium Network, collectively known as Decentralized Network Protocols (DNPs). These DNPs would each be assigned a unique token, referred to as Decentralized Network Tokens (DNTs), and would allow for the HNT-Data Credit burn-and-mint equilibrium as the foundation of the Helium Flywheel to continue, while the corresponding subDAOs determine Proof-of-Coverage rules and earnings for their respective tokens. Currently, the IOT and MOBILE subDAOs are active, as Helium only supports LoRaWAN and 5G. You can check out the Helium GitHub to dive deep on this process and get a sneak peek of other potential protocols that are in discussion.

### Ease of mining: 5/10

As the Helium Network's blockchain and proof of coverage systems continue to strengthen, earning tokens on the network has become a relatively straightforward process. The physical or software maintenance required for hotspots is minimal, as long as they have consistent power and internet connectivity. However, the challenge lies in securing premium physical locations that ensure reliable coverage, which is crucial for optimal earnings on the network.

Mining on the IoT network has always been much simpler and more straightforward than for the MOBILE network. IoT miners are roughly a tenth of the cost of MOBILE miners, can be set up in 10 minutes vs. 30+, and earn much more passively as nearby IoT hotspots beacon off of each other and prove coverage (whereas MOBILE hotspots don’t have nearly the same range and therefore must be validated by modeled rf coverage or a special device that’s coming out soon, called the Spot.
