## About

The **Tokenomics Score** is our subjective measure for the quality of the tokenomic design of a project. This score covers things like: the number and types of tokens in an ecosystem, how demand for the networkâ€™s good/service accrues (or not) to the token, what % of that demand accrues to the token, if there is a supply cap on the token, if there is some kind of balancing system for token burn and emission like BME, net emissions, etc.
