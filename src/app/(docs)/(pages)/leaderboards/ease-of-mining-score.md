## About

The **Ease of Mining Score** is our subjective measure for the relative ease of mining tokens from a project. This score covers things like: if mining is an active or passive activity (if active what action is needed and how often), how expensive in terms of time/money/effort the mining action is to complete, if the action gets more difficult to complete over time, etc. Opex for mining is considered here.
