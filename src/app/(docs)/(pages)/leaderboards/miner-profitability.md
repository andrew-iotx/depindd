## About

In DePIN, the profitability of a miner is measured by the approximate amount of time (in months) that the average hardware miner deployed today on its applicable DePIN network would take to pay itself off. Said another way, the point in time at which:

```shell
cumulative token rewards * current token price = hardware miner cost
```

This does not include opex like electricity, wireless connectivity, etc as these costs are usually minor and can vary greatly across regions, sites, hardware builds, etc.
