DePIN DD is a collective effort initiated by the [Hotspotty](https://twitter.com/hotspotty) team, [Connor Lovely](https://twitter.com/RichhomieconE) and the [IoTeX](https://twitter.com/iotex_io) team to bring ease and transparency in evaluating DePIN projects. By tackling this as a collective effort, we can get much more and better work done, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem and generating more value collectively.

As **DePIN DD** is an [open-source project](https://github.com/hotspotty/depindd), we welcome and appreciate contributions by fellow community members. This table above lists the contributors to the project.
