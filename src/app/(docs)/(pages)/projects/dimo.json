      "description": "DIMO's community governance is considered strong, as demonstrated by the creation of DIP-6, which outlines governance for the DIMO Foundation, an entity registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA). Digital Infrastructure Inc., the corporation that initially developed DIMO, still plays a role in the network through a legal services agreement with the Foundation. However, all decisions are made by the community and are pushed through by the Foundation, which covers important roles such as being the smart contract admin, treasury allocation, enacting contracts to pursue network duties, using IP and the DIMO brand as seen fit by the community, and revoking any licenses in instances of malice. These powers are enacted solely through the involvement of the community via DIPs. If you're interested in learning more, we suggest taking a look at [DIP-6](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/dip6)."

      "description": "In its current state the ease of mining on DIMO is arguably one of the easiest within the DePIN ecosystem and is fairly passive once installed. ince rewards are accrued via the baseline issuance, users are incentivized simply by how active they are on the network and ensuring their hardware device is connected to their car and the app. As the network matures, the difficulty will increase in order to achieve several goals. Firstly, it will incentivize a continuous data connection, which will allow for a fuller story of driver behavior and vehicle performance to be captured over a longer period of time. Secondly, it will reward those who provide a greater quantity and frequency of reliable data, as this will be more valuable to the network than sporadic or low-quality data. Finally, the system will avoid rewarding based on distance or time traveled, as this could incentivize unnecessary and wasteful driving behavior that would not benefit the network or its users."
