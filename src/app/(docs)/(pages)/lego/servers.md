## About

Server networks are groups of computers that work together to provide various web-based services by tapping into idle storage, compute, and bandwidth resources.

## Categories

### Compute

Compute Networks can be divided into two main classifications: general purpose (GP) compute networks and specific purpose (SP) compute networks. GP compute networks provide computing resources that can be used for a variety of applications. SP compute networks are tailored to specific use cases such as transcoding, rendering, and machine learning.

### CDN

Content Delivery Networks (CDN) deliver data at high speeds by caching copies of data closer to usersâ€™ locations.

### VPN

Virtual Private Networks (VPN) provide a secure connection between a user's device and the internet, creating a private network while using public networks.
