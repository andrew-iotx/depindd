## About

### What is this network?

Founded in 2022, XNET aims to establish a comprehensive voice and data network functioning as an authentic mobile network operator (MNO). The incentivization to build out this network is the crypto rewards via their token $XNET that is held on Polygon. In contrast to Helium, Pollen, and several Private LTE networks that depend on CBRS and solely offer mobile data services, XNET aims to provide a comprehensive range of mobile network services. These services will include phone numbers, voice calls, SMS, and e911 capability, thereby delivering a full spectrum of mobile network services to users. In addition to their own network, one of XNET's priorities is to strategically target areas that are presently underserved by major operators to become a compelling option for them.

### How can I mine $XNET tokens?

XNET's ecosystem consists of three key players: XNET Node Operators (Enablers), XNET Validators, and XNET Mobile Network Operator (XNETMNO). For you to get involved with the XNET network and to mine $XNET you will want to become an enabler, validator (coming soon), or both. Enablers are individuals who operate the physical XNET nodes. Navigate to XNET’s shop [here](https://shop.xnet.company/) to purchase a node to get started deploying.

Validators are responsible for validating and securing the XNET network by challenging nodes to prove coverage and network quality, and anyone with a supported smartphone can become a Validator. This participatory role within XNET is not quite available yet and it is important to bear in mind that it will result in lower rewards compared to the enabler role.

### Any geographical restrictions?

At the start, XNET will be launched in the United States, due to the current constraints of the CBRS spectrum. The XNET team is hopeful for expansion into several other countries worldwide, as CBRS spectrum becomes available and rulemaking is respectively coordinated. However, XNET mining rewards will only initially be accessible to users located within their initial cluster footprint, which includes Greater San Francisco, Greater Los Angeles, New York City, Miami, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, and Washington D.C. These footprints are another differentiator in the XNET strategy to build out their MNO by carefully choosing specific target areas.

### How can I optimize my mining rewards?

At the moment, optimizing your mining rewards are dependent on the four factors that all play into XNET’s cluster reward system. Your focus should be on the location of your XNET node and whether or not it is validated with the [explorer](https://explorer.xnetmobile.com/). These factors are gold hexes, silver hexes, eligible zip codes, and ineligible zip codes. Gold hexes offer the highest reward and have the greatest potential for monetization. Silver hexes provide a moderate reward and possess a moderate potential for monetization. Eligible zip codes are metropolitan areas where radios will only earn baseline tokens. Ineligible zip codes are areas where radios deployed will not receive any tokens.

Placing your node in the right spot is the key to maximizing your mining rewards. Take a look at XNET’s explanation on their cluster reward system [here](https://medium.com/@XNET_Mobile/xnet-2023-cluster-updates-237a92e773ad)

### How can I use the network?

At the moment XNET is still prioritizing building out the network and making sure that infrastructure for paying traffic is properly developed. They have mentioned that eSIMs will eventually become available however this is not a priority at the moment. Their focus is ensuring that the network can produce earnings with data traffic before allowing use for their users.

### Who governs this network?

The current governance of XNET is somewhat centralized through XNET, Inc. as it is still in its beginning phases of building the network. They intend to keep the MNO back-end of XNET centralized, as it is the standard in the telecom space. They do however, aim to gradually decentralize the governance of the on-chain components to a stakeholder governance model, via the XNET Foundation DAO which they believe is the best way to support the network's long-term value. The XNET Foundation DAO will be responsible for this governance and will hold around 1/3 of the total $XNET tokens. They suggest that if the XNET Foundation DAO’s treasury grows to a substantial amount down the line, buying a controlling interest in XNET, Inc can ensure stakeholder governance of the entire system.

## Data sources and calculations

### Average monthly USD earnings

Yearly token rewards for Felix or Lucius nodes are listed [here](https://www.xnet.company/files/Phase_X.pdf) (for first 5,000 nodes deployed for Phase X). Divide by 12 to get monthly token rewards. Multiply by [current token price](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xbc5eb84c052fd012bb902c258c9fd241b17c0005&outputCurrency=0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174&swapIndex=0). Divide by (number of “x sites with radios”\*1.5) from [XNET explorer](https://explorer.xnetmobile.com/) (”x sites” are XNET gateways, of which about half house two earning radios. Hence the 1.5x multiplier).

Note: above calculation takes into account decreasing rewards from coverage, validation, and staking over time as the network grows because it assumes linear network growth to 6,000 nodes in the first 12 months of operation. Network went live on 11/14/22. See [here](https://www.xnet.company/files/Phase_X.pdf) for more detail.

Calculation for (11/14/22 - 11/14/23): 41,000 XNET tokens issued per year/12 months*current token price/(number of “x sites with radios”*1.5) = average monthly USD earnings.

### Average miner price

There are currently two miners, sold by XNET, listed [here](https://shop.xnet.company/). Average price is (($1,795+$2,195)/2) = $1,995.

Note: XG1 Marconi Gateway (not included above) costs $995 and can be used to reflash certain DeWi radios that are operating on another DeWi network (such as Helium or Pollen). This option is excluded from the above calculation for simplicity.
