DePIN = Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks

---

## Introduction

DePIN is a way to use blockchain technology to build physical networks, like internet connectivity or power grids, from the ground up without needing to rely on big companies or governments to do it. Instead, people can work together and get rewarded with tokens to build and maintain these networks. This could make it cheaper, more secure, and more efficient to build and use these networks in the future.

## Categories

DePIN projects can be split up in four categories according to Sami Kassab in [Messari's DePIN Sector Map](https://messari.io/report/the-depin-sector-map):
