DePIN DD is an open-source research hub for the DePIN sector, developed by Hotspotty, Connor Lovely, and Hugo Le Helley. Its goal is to provide accurate, aggregated data that will assist everyone from retail network deployers to professional investors in their diligence process.

DePIN DD helps answer questions like “Which DePIN project should I buy hardware for?”, “What are the governance and tokenomics like for this project vs. that one?”, “How difficult will it be to mine tokens from this project?”, “Where can I buy a miner?” and so on and so forth.
