Decentralized sensor networks consist of a network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors that collect real-time data from the physical world, then transmit it to a gateway for processing and analysis. The data gathered by these networks can include environmental and weather data, vehicle and traffic data, and street view and aerial imagery data.
