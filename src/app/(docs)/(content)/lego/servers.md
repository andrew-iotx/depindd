Server networks are groups of computers that work together to provide various web-based services by tapping into idle storage, compute, and bandwidth resources.The decentralized server sector category consists of four network categories:

- **Storage Networks** can be classified into file storage and relational database networks. File storage networks are intended for long-term data storage and archiving. Relational database networks are designed for managing structured data that is accessed and updated frequently.
- **Compute Networks** can be divided into two main classifications: general purpose (GP) compute networks and specific purpose (SP) compute networks. GP compute networks provide computing resources that can be used for a variety of applications. SP compute networks are tailored to specific use cases such as transcoding, rendering, and machine learning.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)** deliver data at high speeds by caching copies of data closer to usersâ€™ locations.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPN)** provide a secure connection between a user's device and the internet, creating a private network while using public networks.
